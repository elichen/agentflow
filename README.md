# AgentFlow
AgentFlow is an open-source framework for creating persistent, intelligent AI agents capable of managing tasks and actions across extended periods. It breaks free from the constraints of traditional chat-based AI interactions, enabling the development of always-on agents that can schedule and execute tasks autonomously.

# Configuration
Before running the application, make sure to update the `config.yaml` file with your Slack and Anthropic API tokens:

2. Replace `your_slack_bot_token_here` with your Slack bot token
3. Replace `your_slack_user_token_here` with your Slack user token
4. Replace `your_anthropic_api_key_here` with your Anthropic API key
