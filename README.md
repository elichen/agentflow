# AgentFlow
AgentFlow is an open-source framework for creating persistent, intelligent AI agents capable of managing tasks and actions across extended periods. It breaks free from the constraints of traditional chat-based AI interactions, enabling the development of always-on agents that can schedule and execute tasks autonomously.
